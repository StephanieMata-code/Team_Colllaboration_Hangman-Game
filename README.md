# Team_Colllaboration_Hangman-Game
Using Java and a SQL database to create a hangman game through team collaboration. Our game players can register or log in to play and can see their number of losses and wins. A random word will be selected for users to guess depending on the category (e.g., movies, animals, countries) they choose. Players can reveal a hint (one hint per word).
